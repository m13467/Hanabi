# Hanabi
This is a digitalized version of Hanabi the card game. 

## My Outline
Probably will be best to test with a UI working
### UI
- Show back of your hand with certain cards labeled with the information that you have received.
- Display other player's hands (Best in Landscape mode, but make it good for either)
- When the user selects a player, the player's hand will enlarge to fill the screen
- Display of public knowledge (stacks, discard, # of hint tokens, countdown to bomb explosion) 
### Coding
- Total top of stacks to find score
- Computer players
  - If obvious discard, discard (number and/or color is not playable)
  - If obvious play, play (number has high chance, know number and color and that is what is needed, maybe if one specific card was pointed out recently)
  - If no hint option and none of the above, then discard oldest card or random with no info.
